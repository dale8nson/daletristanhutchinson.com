We’re so glad you found us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\" eplus-wrapper\">To tell you a little about myself, I come from Australia, the land of surf and sun, which is where I grew up. After working briefly as a lawyer, I began writing for various newspapers and magazines all over the world, including a music magazine, an international health magazine and a political monthly, the last two of which I edited.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\" has-paragraph-font-size eplus-wrapper\">I worked on newspapers and magazines all over the world, as well as working on Fleet Street, and at an international news agency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\" has-paragraph-font-size eplus-wrapper\">I specialise in celebrity and political interviews, reported several wars and conflicts, and even lived with a tribe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\" has-paragraph-font-size eplus-wrapper\">About four years ago, I decided to start a magazine concerning culture and politics. Unfortunately, life intervened. My mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, and it fell to me and my brother to take care of her. She died in 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\" has-paragraph-font-size eplus-wrapper\">A year prior, I was diagnosed with Glaucoma and Meniere’s Disease, which I had never previously heard of. The first doctor I went to – a world-renowned surgeon – told me that I had come to him too late, and more cogently, that “my life was over.” I decided that it wasn’t. I decided that I didn’t want it to be over, particularly my working life, and this online magazine is a result of that resolve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\" has-paragraph-font-size eplus-wrapper\">Without boring you any further about the detritus of my life, let me tell you a little bit about the magazine and also what we hope to achieve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\" has-paragraph-font-size eplus-wrapper\">When I was a teenager, I used to read Playboy (yes, I really read it for the articles), and I found the Playboy interviews endlessly fascinating. In fact, it’s how I found my journalistic idol, Oriana Fallaci, the inimitable Italian journalist, whose books I read and decided to model my own interviews on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\" has-paragraph-font-size eplus-wrapper\">For some reason, Playboy stopped doing these interviews, and I have decided to bring the concept back. So, every month, you will find a lengthy Q&amp;A interview with a celebrity or politician&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\" has-paragraph-font-size eplus-wrapper\">You will also find book, film and music reviews in our Arts section, along with a monthly lift-out where we will focus on a particular issue or a historical or political event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\" has-paragraph-font-size eplus-wrapper\">I should also indicate what this magazine stands for. It stands for human rights, gay rights, and women’s rights (i.e. gender equality, parity, and reproductive rights).</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\" has-paragraph-font-size eplus-wrapper\">Global warming is the clear and present danger. Everywhere we look, we see environmental devastation; the felling of rainforests, and the critical endangerment of our flora and fauna. I plan to highlight that wherever we can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\" has-paragraph-font-size eplus-wrapper\">I am personally against the death penalty, and in each issue we will highlight a particular case of someone on Death Row somewhere in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\" has-paragraph-font-size eplus-wrapper\">Again, I welcome you to our magazine. Please feel free to tell us what you like and indeed, what you don’t like, ‘cos we need to hear that too. We’re always interested in story ideas, so if you want us to take on a story, let us know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\" has-paragraph-font-size eplus-wrapper\">Our first edition will be online in two weeks.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:3rem\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\" wp-block-spacer eplus-wrapper\"></div>\n</div>\n"}}}
